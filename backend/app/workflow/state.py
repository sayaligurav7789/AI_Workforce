"""Shared state carried through the LangGraph workflow.

The state holds a small, JSON-friendly summary of each agent's output. The full
artifacts (requirements, tasks, sprints, ...) stay in PostgreSQL where the agents
already persist them; the state records what was produced and which run produced it.

Only agents that exist today populate their field. ``architecture``, ``code`` and
``test_results`` are declared so future agents can use them, and stay absent until
those agents exist.
