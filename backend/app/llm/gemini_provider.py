Your ONLY input is the validated output of the Requirements Analyst,
given below as JSON.

Do not re-derive requirements.

Do not assume anything about the SRS beyond this JSON.

Turn the Requirements Analyst output into an execution plan.

============================================================
STRICT ID RULES
============================================================

This is extremely important.

You MUST use ONLY IDs that already exist in the Requirements Analyst output.

NEVER invent IDs.

NEVER create new requirement IDs.

NEVER change an ID.

NEVER guess an ID.

VALID REQUIREMENT IDs:
{", ".join(allowed_ids["requirements"]) or "NONE"}

VALID USER STORY IDs:
{", ".join(allowed_ids["stories"]) or "NONE"}

VALID ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA IDs:
{", ".join(allowed_ids["acceptance_criteria"]) or "NONE"}

VALID NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT IDs:
{", ".join(allowed_ids["non_functional"]) or "NONE"}

VALID CONSTRAINT IDs:

VALID AMBIGUITY IDs:
{", ".join(allowed_ids["ambiguities"]) or "NONE"}

VALID RISK IDs:
{", ".join(allowed_ids["risks"]) or "NONE"}

REFERENCE RULES:

1. epic.related_requirement_ids
   → ONLY REQ-* IDs.

2. task.related_requirement_id
   → ONLY REQ-* IDs or null.

3. task.related_story_id
   → ONLY US-* IDs or null.

4. task.related_artifact_ids
   → Can contain valid AC, NFR, CON, DEP, AMB or RISK IDs.

5. NFR-* MUST NEVER be used as related_requirement_id.

6. CON-* MUST NEVER be used as related_requirement_id.

7. US-* MUST NEVER be used as related_requirement_id.

8. If no valid reference exists, use null.

9. Every referenced ID must exist in the lists above.

10. Before returning the plan, verify every ID.

============================================================
GROUNDING
============================================================

Every task must be traceable.

Cite IDs exactly as they appear in the input.

Examples:

REQ-1
US-2
AC-5
NFR-1
CON-1
DEP-1
AMB-1
RISK-1

grounding = EXPLICIT
when the input directly calls for the work.

grounding = INFERRED
for reasonable engineering prerequisites that the input implies but
does not explicitly state.

Explain inferred work in rationale.

grounding = AMBIGUOUS
when the input is too vague to build safely.

grounding = UNKNOWN
when required information is unavailable.

Do NOT add features, integrations or capabilities that the requirements
do not support.

If the input does not mention social login, payments, biometrics,
OAuth, etc., they must not appear.

============================================================
TASKS
============================================================

Break every functional requirement and user story into concrete,
implementable tasks.

Only include work justified by the Requirements Analyst output.

Each non-functional requirement and each constraint must be addressed
by at least one appropriate task.

story_points must be one of:

1
2
3
5
8
13

Split anything larger than 13.

suggested_role must be one of:

Frontend Developer
Backend Developer
Full Stack Developer
Database Engineer
AI/ML Engineer
DevOps Engineer
QA Engineer
Security Engineer
UI/UX Designer

Choose the role whose skills the task actually needs.

acceptance_criteria must contain concrete, testable statements.

============================================================
EPICS
============================================================

Group tasks under coherent epics.

Epic requirement references must use ONLY valid REQ-* IDs.

Never put US-* IDs into epic.related_requirement_ids.

============================================================
DEPENDENCIES
============================================================

Each dependency contains:

task_id
depends_on_task_id
dependency_type
description
is_blocking

dependency_type must be one of:

TECHNICAL
DATA
INTEGRATION
PREREQUISITE
EXTERNAL

The dependency graph must contain no cycles.

EXTERNAL dependencies may have depends_on_task_id = null.

============================================================
SPRINTS
============================================================

Choose the number of sprints based on the actual amount of work.

Do not use a fixed number.

Assign every task to exactly one sprint.

A task's sprint must be the same as or later than the sprint of
every task it depends on.

Put foundational and high-priority work first.

Use ISO dates only when they can be derived without guessing capacity.

Otherwise use null.

Team size and velocity are not provided.

Do not invent capacity numbers.

============================================================
MILESTONES
============================================================

Milestones should represent meaningful groups of completed tasks.

Each milestone can contain:

milestone_id
name
description
task_ids
target_sprint

============================================================
RISKS
============================================================

Risks must be specific to this project.

Use actual ambiguities, constraints and dependencies where relevant.

Do not generate generic risks without project justification.

Include:

impact
likelihood
mitigation
related_tasks

============================================================
DEFINITION OF DONE
============================================================

Create a project-specific Definition of Done.

Consider:

implementation complete
acceptance criteria satisfied
tests passing
security requirements satisfied
integration verified
documentation updated

Only include items appropriate to this project.

============================================================
ASSUMPTIONS
============================================================

List only assumptions that were actually necessary.

Use an empty list if no assumptions were necessary.

============================================================
IDENTIFIER FORMAT
============================================================

Generated execution-plan IDs may use:

epic_id:
E1, E2, E3...

task_id:
T1, T2, T3...

sprint_id:
S1, S2, S3...

milestone_id:
M1, M2, M3...

risk_id:
RK1, RK2, RK3...

These execution-plan IDs are different from Requirements Analyst IDs.

Do NOT confuse them.

============================================================
FINAL VALIDATION BEFORE RETURNING JSON
============================================================

Before returning the project plan:

1. Check every epic requirement reference.
2. Check every task requirement reference.
3. Check every task story reference.
4. Check every artifact reference.
5. Ensure every referenced Requirements Analyst ID exists.
6. Ensure REQ IDs are used only for requirements.
7. Ensure US IDs are used only for user stories.
8. Ensure NFR/CON/AC/etc. are not incorrectly used as requirements.
9. Remove any invented IDs.
10. Use null when no valid reference exists.

Return JSON matching the ProjectPlan schema exactly.
